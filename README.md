# EPP Final Project

This git repository has the source code for my final project for Effective Programming.

## Classification of Finacial Banking Dataset using Decision Tree

The Decision Tree algorithm is implemented using python without using ready-made libraries like sklearn. 

The aim of this project is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) to a term deposit, by building a classification model using Decision Tree. 

The model is trained with the training data(new_train.csv) and is evaluated with test data(new_test.csv)

Since, I had limited knowledge about programming before taking up this course, I wanted to implement a algorithm by scratch without using ready to use libraries. This task has given me the confidence to implement concepts by understanding in python. I also have the idea of doing my master thesis in Finance. This experience will definetely be useful for my thesis. The course has also given me through understanding of using GIT,other IDE's like Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook etc and following the code standards.


## Environment

I have provided my conda environment as a yaml file(meghana_jayadevan_env.yml) for executing the project.

After activating my environment, to execute the decision tree:


```python
cd EffectiveProgramming/decisiontree

python3 decision_tree.py

```
